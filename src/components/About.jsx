         <p>
            Hi! First of all, if you're reading this, then thank you! I'm a frontend web developer specialized in React JS and many of its libraries, I've always had an immense passion for design and UI thinking, and, therefore, I have been doing it as a hobbie for almost two years.
         </p>

         <p>
            I got to learn web design and React through some Udemy courses and self-teaching through researches I used to do whenever I wanted to make something different in my projects. Now I decided to do it for a living. Check my work below!
